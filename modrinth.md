Additionally, holding shift on the balance button you can also quickly spread a single stack over the entire grid, right-clicking the result slot will craft en entire stack, and there's a keybind for compressing stacks of items to its 3x3 or 2x2 recipe through a key press.

- Rotate the outer circle of the crafting grid
- Balance the materials in the crafting grid to even stack sizes
- Clear the crafting grid into your inventory
- Transfer items into the grid by holding the W key while clicking them (Shift+W transfers all of type)
- Instantly compress or decompress blocks into their block/ingot forms through a keybind
- Right-click the result slot to craft a full stack
